# Problem Statement: Privacy-Preserving Matchmaking for Genetic Data in Rare Disease Research

## The Challenge

Genetic data contains deeply personal information that, once shared, cannot be made private again. Despite legal protections like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), significant privacy risks persist:

- **Re-identification Risks:** Even anonymized genetic datasets can often be re-identified by linking them with publicly available data, threatening patient privacy and confidentiality.  
  *(Gymrek et al., Science, 2013; [NHGRI, NIH](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination))*

- **Discrimination Concerns:** Patients worry that their genetic information might be used to discriminate against them in employment, insurance, or social contexts, leading to hesitation or refusal to share data.  
  *(Harvard Health Blog, [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination), [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-2008))*

## The Impact

- Over **300 million people worldwide live with rare diseases**, 72% of which have a genetic basis.  
  *([Global Genes](https://globalgenes.org/rare-facts/))*

- Many of these patients face **isolation, misdiagnosis, and limited access to clinical trials or research participation** due to a lack of efficient, privacy-conscious matchmaking tools.  
  *([Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases](https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-021-01836-6))*

- Only about **17% of patients feel comfortable sharing their genomic data publicly** due to privacy and control concerns, hampering data sharing and collaboration essential for advancing rare disease research.  
  *([Genetics in Medicine Journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201841))*

## The Gap

Existing platforms either compromise privacy or fail to adequately connect patients with researchers and clinical trials, resulting in:

- Loss of trust and unwillingness to share sensitive genetic data.
- Missed opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment.
- Inefficient recruitment for rare disease studies, limiting progress.

## The Need

A **privacy-preserving, trustless matchmaking solution** that enables patients to securely and anonymously connect with researchers or clinical trials is critically needed.

# How ZK-Match Addresses This

By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and advanced cryptographic techniques, **ZK-Match** enables secure, anonymous matchmaking based on genetic markers without exposing raw genetic data, mitigating privacy risks and fostering greater patient participation in rare disease research.

# Proposed Solution: ZK-Match — Privacy-Preserving Genetic Data Matchmaking

## Overview

**ZK-Match** is a cutting-edge platform that enables secure and anonymous matchmaking between patients with rare genetic diseases and researchers or clinical trial organizers — all while preserving the privacy of sensitive genetic data.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  
  Allow patients to prove genetic compatibility or disease markers without revealing any raw genetic data. This cryptographic technique ensures privacy and trustlessness.

- **Decentralized and Trustless:**  
  No central authority holds or accesses raw genomic data, reducing risks of data breaches or misuse.

- **Selective Disclosure:**  
  Patients can choose exactly what minimal information to share, enabling fine-grained control over their data.

- **Anonymous Matchmaking:**  
  Securely connects patients and researchers based on encrypted genetic markers, enabling collaboration without exposing identities.

- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  Designed to comply with data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring legal safety and ethical handling of data.

## Benefits

- **Enhances Patient Privacy:**  
  Eliminates risk of re-identification or discrimination by keeping sensitive genetic data encrypted and private.

- **Increases Research Participation:**  
  Builds patient trust, encouraging greater willingness to participate in rare disease research and clinical trials.

- **Accelerates Rare Disease Discoveries:**  
  Facilitates faster and more accurate matching, improving recruitment for clinical trials and accelerating new treatments.

- **Empowers Patients:**  
  Patients retain ownership and control over their genetic information, improving transparency and consent.

## Technical Approach

- Use cryptographic protocols to generate ZK proofs attesting to the presence of certain genetic markers relevant to specific rare diseases.
- Store only encrypted or hashed genetic profiles on-chain or in secure decentralized storage.
- Match patients and trials by verifying ZK proofs without exposing underlying data.
- Integrate with existing healthcare and research infrastructures via secure APIs.
